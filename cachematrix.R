## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse 
##   of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly. The following pair of functions can be used to cache 
##   the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object (a list) that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(Inverse) m <<- Inverse
  getInverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##   If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve 
##   should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setInverse(m)
  m  
}
